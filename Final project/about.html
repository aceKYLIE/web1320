            <h3>Rock city</h3>
            <p>  A short distance up the lookout mountain right on the edge of the city is Rock City.  Rock City is a beautiful destination with gardens, waterfalls and lovers leap bluff where you are able to see four different states and be able to look out over Chattanooga. In addition, rock city is almost always seasonally decorated. My personal favorites are spring blooms and Christmas. </p>

            <h3>Ruby falls    </h3>
            <p>Ruby falls is a spectacular sight.  The underground waterfall is visited all year round by tourists and Chattanoogans alike.  The 145-foot fall drops into a crystal-clear cave pool before continuing its way down the mountain. This should defiantly end up on the must see list. </p>

            <h3>Hiking  </h3>
            <p>If you are into hiking and water falls you should defiantly check out the local trails.  I love to hike and have been on most of the trails in the area. The list below contains the best locally rated waterfalls, and I must agree. </p>
