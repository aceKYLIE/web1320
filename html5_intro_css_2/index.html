            <h2>How to Identify a Crow </h2>
            <p>A crow is a medium sized black bird much like a raven or a rook.  So how do we tell them apart?  crows have a fan tail, and the rook and the raven have wedge shaped tail, which is visible in flight. Crows have a very thick bill like the raven. However, when compared the rooks bill is thin and light gray unlike the black of the other two birds. Bothe the raven and the rook have scruffy feathers around their neck and legs, but the crow is known to have sleeker and more polished feathers. Finaly, the raven and the rook both have a deeper and raspier call than the crow. </p>
